Data Analysis Models
====================

Overview
--------

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models and techniques for data analysis. Each model is applied to a sample dataset and evaluated to demonstrate its capabilities and performance. The goal is to explore and compare the strengths and limitations of different machine learning algorithms in diverse scenarios.

Features
--------

*   **Linear Regression**
    
    *   Explores relationships between dependent and independent variables.
        
    *   Includes performance evaluations using R-squared scores.
        
*   **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
    
    *   A simple, non-parametric algorithm for classification.
        
    *   Evaluates performance based on accuracy scores.
        
*   **Logistic Regression**
    
    *   A robust model for binary classification problems.
        
    *   Provides insights into feature importance and predictions.
